spatialwarnings v1.4.0 (Release date: unknown)
===============================================

Improvements: 
  * Increase the precision of the optimizer when fitting distributions. This 
      fixes some differences in results produced by this package and the 
      poweRlaw package. (FIXME: check that it really fixes the problems)
  
  * Significance of Power-law range can be tested using `indictest()`. Using 
      `plot_distr()` on the resulting objects will display the 0.05/0.95 
      quantiles of null patch size distributions. 

Removals: 
  * All the deprecated `*_spews` functions are now defunct. 

Misc changes: 
  * Minor changes in print/summary methods


spatialwarnings v1.3.1 (Release date: 2018-12)
===============================================

New indicators:
  * Planar flowlength (Mayor et al. 2013, Rodriguez et al. 2017)
  * Kolmogorov complexity based on Block Decomposition Method
      (Dakos and Soler-Toscano 2016)

Improvements:
  * Enable parallel computation of patch size distributions
  * Added a dataset of aerial view of vegetation in Arizona ('arizona')
  * Added functions to compute the coarse-grained variance/skewness on a
      single matrix

Bug fixes and code improvements:
  * Added missing methods exports for custom indicators
  * Fixed the patch labelling for non-square images
  * General code cleanup and improvement

Documentation and description changes:
  * Updated references to reflect the publication of new paper presenting
      the package <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13058>


spatialwarnings v1.2 (Release date: 2018-06)
===============================================

Bug fixes:
  * Compilation errors should be fixed on Solaris
  * Fixed coarse-graining bug when input values are non-integer


spatialwarnings v1.1 (Release date: 2018-06)
===============================================

This release provides changes as to satisfy referees' comments
prior to the publication of the package, as long as minor
improvements in documentation.

New features:
  * Support for custom indicators (see ?create_indicator)

Minor changes:
  * Documentation improvements
  * Safer handling of small matrices in SDR computation

Name changes
  * `*_spews` functions are now deprecated in favor of `*_sews` functions

Bug fixes
  * Counting patches in matrices with 1 line or 1 column
    does not crash R anymore
  * The R package should now build on Solaris


spatialwarnings v1.0 (Release date: 2017-11-03)
