# Indictest is a method for testing the significance of spatial indicators

# This file only defines the global method and maybe some helpers. For each

#' @description Assess the significance of spatial early-warning indicators
#' 
#' @param x A spatial warning object such as one produced by the \code{*_sews}
#'   functions, or \code{\link{compute_indicator}}
#' 
#' @param nulln The number of values to compute to produce the null 
#'   distribution 
#' 
#' @param null_method The method used to produce the null values (see Details)
#' 
#' @param null_control List of arguments used to control the generation of 
#'   null matrices. If NULL, then arguments then sensible defaults are chosen 
#'   (see Details)
#' 
#' @param ... Additional arguments are ignored
#' 
#' @return An object with a class ending in \code{*_sews_test}, whose exact
#'   class depends on the input object. \code{plot}, \code{summary} methods are
#'   available to display the results of computations, and additional methods
#'   may be available depending on the input object (e.g. see
#'   \code{\link{patchdistr_sews_plot}}).

#' @details 
#' 
#' \code{indictest} is used to test the significance of early-warning signals
#'   against 'null matrices', which represent the expected spatial structure 
#'   in the absence of the biological process of interest. 
#' 
#' For a given indicator, a null distribution is obtained by producing a set 
#'   of 'null' matrices, from which indicator values are recomputed. This
#'   produces a null distribution of \code{nulln} indicator values against
#'   which the observed value is tested. 
#' 
#' Several methods are available to produce the set of null matrices. If 
#'   \code{null_method} is set to "perm", the original matrix is reshuffled 
#'   to obtain a null matrix. If \code{null_method} is set to "intercept", then 
#'   a generalized linear model of the form `y ~ 1` (where y represents the 
#'   values of the matrix) is fitted, then values are drawn from this model. If 
#'   \code{null_method} is set to "smooth", then a smooth surface is fitted
#'   based on a generalized additive model (using \code{\link[=mgcv]{gam}}) to
#'   the matrix, then values are drawn from this model. When using the
#'   "intercept" or "smooth" null models, it is important to make sure the
#'   model 'family' corresponds to the type of values present in the matrix. By
#'   default, if a matrix contains TRUE/FALSE values, a `binomial()` family is
#'   used, otherwise a `gaussian()` family is used. More information about null
#'   models is available in the \href{https://alex.lecairn.org/spatialwarnings-faq.html#Using_advanced_null_models}{spatialwarnings FAQ}. 
#' 
#' Please note that specific null methods may exists for some indicators, such as
#' \code{\link[=flowlength_sews]{flowlength}}. These are often based on 
#' analytical approximation and allow faster computations. 
#' 
#' If a matrix has attributes, then these are preserved and passed to the 
#'   function used to compute the indicator value, except when using the 
#'   null method 'perm', in which case matrix attributes are discarded. 
#' 
#' The list \code{null_control} can be used to adjust the computation of 
#'   null matrices. It can have the following components: 
#'   \itemize{ 
#'     \item `family` The family used in the model used to produce the null 
#'       matrices. Typically, it is one of \code{\link[=stats]{binomial}()}, 
#'       \code{\link[=stats]{binomial}()}, etc. 
#' 
#'     \item `qinf` The lower quantile to compute from the null distribution 
#'       and display in summaries/plots. A numeric value between 0 and 1.
#' 
#'     \item `qsup` The upper quantile to compute from the null distribution 
#'       and display in summaries/plots. A numeric value between 0 and 1.
