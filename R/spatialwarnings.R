#' @title Early Spatial-Warnings of Ecosystem Degradation
#' 
#' @description 
#' 
#' Many dynamical systems such as ecosystems exhibit non-linear responses to 
#' changes in their external drivers, resulting in possible wide state shifts 
#' with strong ecological or economical consequences. This often happens when 
#' a system exhibit a change in its stability properties as a threshold is 
#' crossed, \emph{e.g.} going from multiple stable states to a single stable 
#' state. For a few decades, much research has been dedicated to finding a 
#' way to anticipate these tipping points in ecological systems. This has led 
#' to the suggestion of several indicators that could reflect the proximity 
#' of an ecosystem to a tipping point. 
#' 
#' This package implements the computation of these indicators, or 
#' \emph{early-warning signals} (EWS), on spatial raster data. High-level 
#' functions and methods provide familiar workflows to compute the indicators 
#' and display their variations along environmental gradients or time-series. 
#' Lower-level functions are also available to integrate early-warning signals 
#' into different workflows.
