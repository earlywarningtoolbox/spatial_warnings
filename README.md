Spatial early warning signs - R package
=======================================

This package helps computing spatial early warning signals of critical
transitions. This is part of a collaborative project between [Sonia Kefi's
group](http://sonia.kefi.fr/) (Institut de Sciences d'Evolution, CNRS, IRD,
Université Montpellier, France) and [Vishwesha
Guttal's](https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/) (Center for Ecological Sciences,
Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India).

The R package provides several sets of functions related to the computation of
early warning signals of ecosystem tipping points and irreversible
transitions (also known as *catastrophic shifts*). In particular, it
facilitates computing those indicators, assess their significance and plot
their trends.

To understand the context behind those indicators, and see how they
can be computed, the best way is to have a look at our paper about the package:

[Génin, A. , Majumder, S. , Sankaran, S. , Danet, A. , Guttal, V. , Schneider, F. D. and Kéfi, S. (2018),

a FAQ is also available [there](https://alex.lecairn.org/spatialwarnings-faq.html).

## Installation

`spatialwarnings` is available on CRAN and can be installed through:

```r
install.packages('spatialwarnings')
```

The development version of this package can be installed using the
`devtools` package in R:

```
if ( ! require(devtools) ) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("spatial-ews/spatialwarnings")
```

## The spatial indicators

Ecological systems can suffer drastic transitions such as desertification or
eutrophication, sometimes even after a slight change in one or more external
parameters, such as aridity or nutrient input. These qualitative changes in the
behavior of a system at a threshold represents a critical or bifurcation point,
and can give rise to *catastrophic shifts* when associated with irreversibility.
A growing body of litterature suggests that a dynamical system should exhibit
certain measurable properties around those critical points.

This package aims at providing a practical set of tools for the detection of
these upcoming critical points in spatial datasets, by using indicators based on
those properties. Some of those indicators fall within broad families around 
which the package is centered:
  
  * "Generic" spatial indicators
  * Spectrum-based indicators
  * Indicators based on patch-size distributions

Each of these indicator types can be computed with this package, along with 
other, newer ones. Their significance can be assessed using permutation-based 
tests and results can be displayed using familiar summary/plot methods. 

In total, spatialwarnings provides the following spatial indicators published 
in the literature: 
  
  - lag-1 autocorrelation (Moran's I, Dakos et al. 2010)
  - Variance (Guttal et al. 2008)
  - Skewness (Guttal et al. 2008)
  - SDR Ratio (Kéfi et al. 2014)
  - Patch-size distribution shape (Kéfi et al. 2011)
  - Power-law range (Berdugo et al. 2017)
  - Flowlength (Rodriguez et al. 2017)
  - Kolmogorov complexity (Dakos et al. 2017)

## Code sample

A simple analysis with `spatialwarnings` could fit in a few lines of code: 

```r
> library(ggplot2)
> library(spatialwarnings)
>
> # Compute indicators
> serengeti.ic <- generic_spews(serengeti,
>                               subsize = 5,
>                               moranI_coarse_grain = TRUE)
> serengeti.test <- indictest(serengeti.ic)

```

```r
> # Textual summary of trends
> summary(serengeti.test)
