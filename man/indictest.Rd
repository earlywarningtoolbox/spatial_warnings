\usage{
indictest(x, nulln = 999, null_method = "perm", null_control = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A spatial warning object such as one produced by the \code{*_sews}
functions, or \code{\link{compute_indicator}}}

\item{nulln}{The number of values to compute to produce the null 
distribution}

\item{null_method}{The method used to produce the null values (right now 
only the permutation method is supported, 'perm')}

\item{null_control}{List of arguments used to control the generation of 
null matrices. If NULL, then arguments then sensible defaults are chosen 
(see Details)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments are ignored}
}
\value{
An object with a class ending in \code{*_sews_test}, whose exact
  class depends on the input object. \code{plot}, \code{summary} methods are
  available to display the results of computations, and additional methods
  may be available depending on the input object (e.g. see
  \link{variogram_sews_plot}).

\description{
Assess the significance of spatial early-warning indicators
}
\details{
\code{indictest} is used to test the significance of early-warning signals
  against 'null matrices', which represent the expected spatial structure 
  in the absence of the biological process of interest. 

For a given indicator, a null distribution is obtained by producing a set 
  of 'null' matrices on which indicator values are recomputed. This produces 
  a null distribution of \code{nulln} values against which the observed
  value is tested. 

Several methods are available to produce the set of null matrices. If 
  \code{null_method} is set ot "perm", the original matrix is reshuffled 
  to obtain a null matrix. If the method is "binom", the mean cover of a 
  matrix \deqn{mu} is computed, then the matrix is filled randomly with 
  TRUE values (with probability \deqn{mu}) and FALSE (with probability 
  \deqn{1 - mu}). This method only works with logical matrices (with 
  TRUE/FALSE values). 

\code{null_method} can be set to 'smooth'. In that case, an isotropic spline 
  will be fitted to the matrix (using \link[mgcv]{gam}), and values will 
  be
