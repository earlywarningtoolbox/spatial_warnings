\title{Significance-assessment of spatial early-warning signals}
\usage{
indictest(x, nperm = 999, null_method = "perm",
  covariate_layers = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A spatial warning object such as one produced by the \code{*_sews} 
function family}

\item{nperm}{The number of permutations to carry out to produce the null 
distribution}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods}
}
\value{
An object of class ending in \code{*_sews_test}, whose exact class 
  depends on the input object (in reality a data.frame)
}
\description{
Assess the significance of spatial early-warning values
}
\details{
The significance of many early-warning signals can be estimated by 
  reshuffling the original matrix. Indicators are then recomputed 
  on the shuffled matrices and the values obtained are used as a null 
  distribution. P-values are obtained based on the rank of the observed
  value in the null distribution.
