\title{Early-warning signals based on patch size distributions}
\usage{
\method{plot}{patchdistr_sews}(x, along = NULL, ...)

plot_distr(x, along = NULL, best_only = TRUE, plrange = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object as produced by \code{\link{spectral_sews}}}

\item{along}{A vector providing values over which the indicator trend 
will be plotted. If \code{NULL} then the values are plotted sequentially 
in their original order.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to methods}

\item{best_only}{Plot only the best fit the empirical (inverse cumulative) patch-size 
distribution with an overlay of the estimated fits.}

\item{plrange}{Plot the power-law range}
}
\description{
Plot early-warning signals based on patch size distributions
}
\details{
The \code{plot} function will produce a complex figure summarizing the change 
  in patch size distributions along a set of values. The figure has two 
  panels: 
  \itemize{ 
     \item the upper panel shows the percolation status of empty 
       (\code{FALSE}) and occupied cells (\code{TRUE}), and shows the mean 
       value (proportion of \code{TRUE} values). The background shows 
       the proportion of each type of distribution for each unique values 
       of the \code{along} vector. 
       
     \item the bottom panel displays the power-law range
  }
 
 The \code{plot_spectrum} function displays each distribution in an 
   individual facet, with an overlay of the best distribution fit and a blue 
   bar showing the power-law range. This mode of representation can be 
   cumbersome when working with a high number of matrices but displays the 
   full shape of the distributions.

\dontrun{ 
data(forestgap)
psd_indic <- patchdistr_sews(forestgap)

plot(psd_indic, along = forestgap.pars[ ,"d"]) 

# When along is non-numeric, bars are used for display
plot(psd_indic, along = as.factor(forestgap.pars[ ,"d"]))

# Display individual distributions
plot_distr(psd_indic, along = forestgap.pars[ ,"d"])
