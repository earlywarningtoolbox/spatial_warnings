\title{Get patch sizes.}
\usage{
patchsizes(mat, merge = FALSE, nbmask = matrix(c(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0,
  1, 0), ncol = 3), wrap = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{A logical matrix or a list of these matrices.}

\item{merge}{Controls whether the obtained patch size distributions are to 
be pooled together if mat is a list of matrices.}

\item{nbmask}{a square matrix with an odd number of lines and columns that 
describes which neighbors are to be considered around a cell. Default 
is 4-way neighborhood (the neighborhood of a cell comprises the cell 
above, below, on the right and on the left of the target cell).}

\item{wrap}{Whether to wrap around lattice boundaries (`TRUE`/`FALSE`), 
effectively using periodic boundaries.}
}
\value{
If mat is a logical matrix, then the function returns a vector of 
  patch sizes. If mat is a list of logical matrices, then it returns 
  a list of vectors of patch sizes: this list is flattened if merge is TRUE.
}
\description{
Get the distribution of patch sizes of a logical matrix
}
\examples{

data(forestgap)
patchsizes(forestgap[[5]]) # Use a single matrix

# Compute the average patch size of each matrix
list_patches <- patchsizes(forestgap) # get the patch size for each matrix
print( sapply(list_patches, mean)) # print the average patch size 

# Example with 8-way neighborhood
nbmask8 <- matrix(c(1,1,1,
                    1,0,1,
                    1,1,1), ncol = 3)
patchsizes(forestgap[[5]], nbmask = nbmask8)
