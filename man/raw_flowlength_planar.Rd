\title{Flow length (planar approximation)}
\usage{
raw_flowlength_planar(mat, slope, cell_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{The input matrix (must be a logical matrix)}

\item{slope}{The slope of the area documented by the matrix (in degree).}

\item{cell_size}{The horizontal size of a cell in the matrix (as viewed 
from above).}
}
\value{
The flow length numerical value.
}
\description{
Compute a simple approximation of the flow length assuming a 
  constant slope
}
\details{
This function computes the Flowlength of a given matrix, using a 
    planar approximation (the slope is constant across the whole matrix, 
    with maximum slope being from the top of the matrix to its bottom), 
    as per Rodriguez et al. (2017). See \code{\link{flowlength_sews}} for 
    more details.

\examples{

raw_flowlength_planar(arizona[[1]], slope = 20, cell_size = 1)
