### Discrete power-law distribution with exponential cut-off
# Revision history at end of file

# The normalizing constant of this distribution can only be obtained
# numerically.  A separate C program, contained in the file discpowerexp.C,
# which should accompany this code, does so.  This must be compiled, and the
# executable put someplace where R can run it.
# To install on a Unix system, proceed as follows:
### > gcc discpowerexp.c -O -o discpowerexp -lm
### > mv discpowerexp yourexecutablepath
# where "yourexecutablepath" is a directory where you can put executable files.
# Then edit the variable "discpowerexp.filename", below, to give the full
# path to discpowerexp.
# This is not the world's slickest installation mechanism, no.

### Function for fitting to data:
# discpowerexp.fit	Fit discrete power law with exponential cut-off to
#			right/upper tail of data (by maximum likelihood)
### Distributional functions, per R standards:
# ddiscpowerexp		Probability mass function
### Backstage functions, not intended for users:
# discpowerexp.loglike	Calculate log-likelihood
# discpowerexp.norm	Calculate normalizing constant, by invoking outside
#			routine
# discpowerexp.base	Calculate un-normalized probability mass function
# discpowerexp.log	Calculate log of un-normalized probability mass function


# Location of the external program calculating the normalizing constant
### EDIT THE FILE LOCATION TO GIVE CORRECT PATH ON YOUR SYSTEM!
